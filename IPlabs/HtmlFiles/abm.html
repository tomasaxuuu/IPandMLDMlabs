                Hi, I am a first-year student of UlSTU, Department of Information Systems and Technologies. 
                I entered this university in 2021, after the 11th grade.
                Since childhood, I have been very fond of computer technology and I liked the device of this machine. 
                I got acquainted with programming in the 11th grade, when I decided to take computer science on the Unified State Exam. 
                Now I have a basic command of such languages as: C++, Python, Pascal ABC. I started learning: Java, JS, HTML and CSS. 
                I like the layout and I would like to consolidate my skills in this area. Maybe in the future I can be good)) frontend developer.

                I'll tell you a little about myself:
                My friends call me Tom, I'm 19 years old and I dream of becoming someone in this life. 
                I'm an ordinary guy who has bad habits, but I don't want to fight them) 
                I have people with whom this life is easier and I love them, this is the most important thing for a person. 
                My steps in programming have already begun and I don't want to stop, because it's really very interesting and exciting. 
                I hope I will succeed, and on this site you can follow my work, which has a lot of errors and bugs)
